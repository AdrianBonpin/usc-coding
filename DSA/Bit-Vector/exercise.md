# Bit Vectors Exercise

## 1. Write an appropriate definition of datatype SET such that in the declaration
- A is an array of integers of **size 10** *note: set A is a static array*

## 2. Using your definition of SET in #1, do the following:
- Write the function header of the function *Union()*. The function will return a new set C containing elements found in the given 2 sets A and B.
- Write an appropriate function call *declare* and *initialize* the variables used in the call BEFORE the call.
- Assume that the functon call is in *main()*, draw the execution stack. Label variables with names, values and addresses.
- Write the code of the function
- Simulate code and update the execution stack.

## 3. Using your definition of SET in #1, write the codes of the following operations:
- Intersection
- Set Difference

## 4. What is the running time of each of the operations?
*The running time for each of the operations is O(1).*
